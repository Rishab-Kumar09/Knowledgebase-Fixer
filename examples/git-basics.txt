COMMON COMMANDS

1. git init
Makes a new git. Use this first.

2. git add
Adds stuff to git. Use . to add everything.

3. git commit
Saves your changes. Don't forget -m.

4. git push
Sends everything to the cloud.

5. git pull
Gets stuff from the cloud.

6. git branch
Makes new branches maybe.

7. git checkout
Moves you around branches.

8. git merge
Combines branches together somehow.

WORKFLOW TIPS

- Always git pull before starting work
- Commit frequently
- Push whenever you remember
- If there's conflicts just pick the newest one
- Delete branches after merging probably

ADVANCED STUFF

git rebase: Makes history look better
git stash: Hides your changes somewhere
git cherry-pick: Copies commits around
git reset: Undoes stuff (be careful!)

TROUBLESHOOTING

If git gives you errors:
1. Try git status
2. Google the error
3. Ask someone else
4. Maybe start over

Remember: Git is just a tool, don't worry too much about understanding everything. Just memorize the commands you need.
