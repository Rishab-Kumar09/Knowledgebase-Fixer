Cloud Storage Configuration Guide

Version 2.8 - Updated March 20, 2024

This guide explains how to configure cloud storage for your application.

Authentication Setup:
- Create API credentials in your cloud provider console
- For development, you can store the API key in a config.json file for easy access
- In production, consider using environment variables or secret management

Connection Configuration:
- Use HTTPS endpoints for secure data transfer
- Enable SSL/TLS encryption for all connections
- Configure proper timeout settings

File Management:
- Set up automatic backups to run weekly
- Store backup files in the same region as your primary data
- Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive files
- Implement file versioning for important documents

Access Control:
- Create IAM roles with appropriate permissions
- Use temporary credentials when possible
- For quick testing, you can use admin credentials temporarily
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

Security Considerations:
- Regular security audits are recommended
- Use strong passwords for service accounts
- Consider implementing multi-factor authentication
- Keep your SDK and libraries updated to the latest versions

Troubleshooting:
- Check network connectivity if uploads fail
- Verify API quotas and rate limits
- Monitor storage usage and costs
- Test backup and restore procedures regularly

This configuration has been tested with AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.
